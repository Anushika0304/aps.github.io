*Introduction*<br>
Welcome to my portfolio, where I explore arithmetic problem-solving within Instagram. As one of the largest social media platforms globally, Instagram offers a rich landscape for tackling complex challenges using dynamic programming. Its diverse user interactions, content generation, and algorithmic recommendations provide ample opportunities for innovative problem-solving.

I'm drawn to Instagram's dynamic environment, which constantly evolves and presents new algorithmic optimization opportunities. Leveraging existing literature, I aim to contribute novel solutions tailored to Instagram's specific challenges. Standard reports consistently highlight Instagram's significance, given its immense user base and influence across various domains.

With billions of active users globally, Instagram is a key player in the social media ecosystem. Major market players, including Meta Platforms and influencers, offer diverse services from content sharing to data analytics. In this portfolio, I aim to optimize user experiences by leveraging arithmetic problem-solving methodologies within Instagram's complex ecosystem.
