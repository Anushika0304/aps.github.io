### 🌟 **Introduction**
Welcome to my portfolio, where I delve into the realm of arithmetic problem-solving within Instagram. As one of the world's largest social media platforms, Instagram provides a dynamic environment 🌍 ripe for tackling complex challenges using innovative programming techniques. Its vast user engagement, diverse content generation 📸, and sophisticated algorithms offer a fertile ground for exploring new solutions.

I'm captivated by Instagram's ever-evolving landscape, which continually presents fresh opportunities for algorithmic optimization. Drawing from established methodologies, my goal is to pioneer novel approaches tailored to Instagram's unique challenges. With its global reach and profound impact across various domains 🌐, Instagram stands as a cornerstone of modern social media.

In this portfolio, I explore how arithmetic problem-solving can enhance user experiences within Instagram's intricate ecosystem. 🧠💡

## 💡 Design Challenges & Solutions 
### Posts Categorization Based on Hashtags 🔖

**Challenges and Market Benefits**:
Categorizing posts based on hashtags on platforms like Instagram enhances content discoverability and improves user engagement. However, the challenges include handling vast amounts of user-generated content, ensuring accurate categorization to provide relevant recommendations, and adapting to the dynamic nature of trending hashtags. 📈💬

**Shortcomings and Scalability Issues with LCS:**

* **Time Complexity:** O(m * n), where m and n are the lengths of the hashtag sequences. While suitable for moderate datasets, the quadratic time complexity can become impractical for large-scale applications without optimization. ⏳
* **Semantic Understanding:** LCS may not capture the full semantic meaning or context of hashtags, limiting its ability to categorize based on nuanced topics or trends effectively. 🤔
* **Scalability:** Optimization or parallelization is necessary to handle the extensive volume of posts and hashtags generated on platforms like Instagram. 📈

*Code for sample implementation of [Longest Common Subsequence](all_codes/Longest-Common-Subsequence.cpp)*


**Shortcomings and Scalability Issues with Radix Tree:**

* **Time Complexity:** Insertion, deletion, and search operations are O(l), where l is the length of the tag. This efficiency is suitable for handling real-time hashtag updates and dynamic content categorization. ⚡
* **Space Complexity:** O(n * l), where n is the number of hashtags and l is the average length of hashtags. While generally efficient, the space overhead may become significant with a massive number of distinct hashtags. 🧠
* **Maintenance in Distributed Systems:** Synchronization challenges may arise when maintaining Radix Trees across distributed systems, requiring careful management to ensure consistency and efficiency. 🌐

By leveraging these design techniques, Instagram can effectively categorize posts based on hashtags, enhancing content discoverability, improving user engagement through personalized recommendations, and maintaining a scalable infrastructure to handle the platform's dynamic nature. Each approach offers unique advantages and challenges, depending on the specific requirements and scale of hashtag analysis on social media platforms.
